## description
- this SQ tool is used for histological image staining quantification. 
- it could be used as an alternative of ImageJ for biological image analysis in general.
## algorithm introduction
1. our SQ tool has successfully distinguished region of interest (ROI) in complex scenarios such as (i) the signal of noisy background is stronger than ROI and it is overlaid with ROI; (ii) a strong color contrast for that part of the interested area had very weak signal, etc.
2. details of the algorithm can be found at paper ...
